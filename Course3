Pawan Dubey
Dynamic Programming
Understanding the prolem and implementing a solution which is space and time efficient by structuring it into sub problems.



Saptarshi Ghosh
Dynamic Programming
Understood how dynamic program can save space and time complexity and make the code efficient and also asthetic. It is a very efficient way to deal with recursion problems with very less time complexity.
